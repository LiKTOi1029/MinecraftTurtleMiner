# MinecraftTurtleMiner

**HEADS UP! THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND DOES NOT FUNCTION YET!**

## About This Project
This is the minecraft turtle miner that I originally started as a little personal project of mine that has grown dramatically into one of my largest projects to date. I will be posting my updates on github from now on because I was looking for a script like this about 3 years ago and found none. That's why I am not only uploading it to GitHub but also putting it in the public domain. Do whatever you want with this I don't care.

## Notes
When using this script there are a few things you should keep in mind when first running it in your world:

1. Firstly, this is intended for my own personal minecraft 1.12.2 modded world. This means that if you are using a different version of CraftOS it may malfunction. I am not updating this for those versions do it yourself.
2. Secondly, if you do end up getting this working, please change the `acceptableOres` table to include all of the ores you want the bot to mine out (and update the IDs that are out of date due to the updated minecraft IDs).
3. Thirdly, please do also use the computer script `not added yet` that is provided on a `COMPUTER` using an `ENDER MODEM`. The `ENDER MODEM` must be on both the turtle and the computer. The bot does not need these to function, however a computer would be beneficial in keeping track of the turtle's location and status.
4. Fourthly, be sure to use a `CHUNKLOADER` mod. This should preferably be a block that loads chunks without taking in any fuel. There should at least be 2 chunk loader blocks in its 5th slot (row 2, column 1 from the top left).

## Final Remarks
If this bot doesn't work for you, please don't be rude about it in the issues. **This is not my full time job.**
